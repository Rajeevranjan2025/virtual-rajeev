My name is Rajeev.

I am building an AI project called Virtual Rajeev.

Virtual Rajeev is a personal AI assistant that runs locally using Ollama and a Large Language Model.

The goal of this project is to create a virtual version of myself that can communicate on my behalf using my personal data and knowledge when I am not available.

This assistant is designed to understand my background, interests, and project details so it can answer questions, provide information, and assist others in a way that reflects my own knowledge and preferences.

The purpose of this project is to learn core AI concepts such as Large Language Models, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, and system architecture, while also building an interview-ready real-world AI system.

I am interested in artificial intelligence, software development, and automation.
